DECISION CORRELATION CONTRACT



Sovereignty Control System — Version 0.5



Purpose



This document defines the Decision Correlation Contract for the Sovereignty Control System.



The purpose of this contract is to ensure that every enforced action can be provably linked to the governance decision that authorized, blocked, or paused it.



Without correlation, enforcement cannot be audited.

Without auditability, governance claims are invalid.



Core Principle



Every enforced action must be traceable to a specific governance decision.



This traceability is achieved through a Decision Correlation ID, which forms an immutable link between:



Decision → Enforcement → Outcome





Any action lacking this link is considered unauthorized, regardless of intent or result.



Decision Correlation ID

Definition



A Decision Correlation ID is a unique identifier generated at the time a governance decision is evaluated.



It represents the authoritative reference for:



The decision itself



All enforcement behavior derived from that decision



All downstream records and outcomes



Generation Rules



A correlation ID must be generated for every governance decision



It must be:



Globally unique



Immutable



Non-reusable



It must be generated before enforcement begins



Correlation IDs must not be derived from:



User input



Action identifiers



External systems



Required Decision Record Fields



Every governance decision must produce a record containing at minimum the following fields:



decision\_correlation\_id



timestamp



identity\_label



requested\_action



system\_state



decision\_outcome

(ALLOW, DENY, or REQUIRE\_ADDITIONAL\_APPROVAL)



policy\_ids



decision\_reason



This record represents the authoritative decision artifact.



Required Enforcement Record Fields



Every enforced action must record at minimum the following fields:



decision\_correlation\_id



timestamp



action\_identifier



enforcement\_result

(EXECUTED, BLOCKED, or PAUSED)



enforcement\_reason



policy\_ids



The decision\_correlation\_id must match the ID generated by the governance decision.



Correlation Rules

Rule 1: Mandatory Correlation



An enforced action must not execute, block, or pause unless a valid decision correlation ID is present.



If no correlation ID exists, the action is invalid.



Rule 2: One Decision, One Correlation ID



Each governance decision produces exactly one correlation ID.



Multiple actions may reference the same correlation ID only if they are explicitly defined as part of the same governed action.



Rule 3: No Substitution



Correlation IDs must not be:



Reused across unrelated decisions



Regenerated during enforcement



Substituted with external identifiers



The original decision correlation ID is authoritative.



Paused Actions and Correlation



When an action is paused due to REQUIRE\_ADDITIONAL\_APPROVAL:



The correlation ID remains active



All pause records reference the same correlation ID



Resumption of the action requires:



Satisfaction of policy-defined conditions



A new governance decision



A new correlation ID authorizing execution



Paused actions must never execute under the original correlation ID.



Audit Guarantees



The Decision Correlation Contract guarantees that auditors can determine:



Which governance decision authorized or blocked an action



Which policies were responsible



When the decision occurred



Whether enforcement complied with the decision



Whether any action executed without authorization



An inability to establish this chain constitutes a governance failure.



Prohibited Behaviors



The following are explicitly forbidden:



Executing actions without a correlation ID



Generating correlation IDs outside governance evaluation



Modifying correlation IDs after creation



Allowing enforcement systems to invent or infer correlation



Any system exhibiting these behaviors is non-compliant.



Scope Boundary



This contract defines correlation requirements only.



It does not specify:



Storage formats



Database schemas



Transport mechanisms



Visualization or reporting tools



Those concerns must comply with this contract but are defined elsewhere.



Summary



The Decision Correlation Contract ensures that governance decisions are not only made, but obeyed and provable.



Every action must be able to answer one question definitively:



“Which governance decision authorized this?”



If that question cannot be answered, the action is invalid.
