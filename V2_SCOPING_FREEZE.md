Sovereignty Control System (SCS)  

v2 Design Scope — Intentional Freeze Marker



---



\## Purpose



This document formally records the decision to \*\*intentionally shelve v2 implementation\*\* of the Sovereignty Control System.



v2 has been \*\*fully scoped\*\*, \*\*explicitly bounded\*\*, and \*\*deliberately deferred\*\*.



This is not abandonment.  

It is a governance decision.



---



\## Current Authoritative Runtime



The authoritative, review-ready system remains:



\- \*\*Runtime version:\*\* v1.4

\- \*\*Canonical runtime tag:\*\* `v1.4-policy-bundle-signatures`

\- \*\*Documentation snapshot:\*\* `docs-external-complete`



All audits, reviews, grants, and demonstrations reference \*\*v1.4 behavior only\*\*.



---



\## v2 Status Summary



v2 exists \*\*only\*\* as a documented design space.



\- No v2 code exists

\- No v2 data exists

\- No v2 runtime artifacts exist

\- No migrations are authorized

\- No partial implementations are permitted



v2 is \*\*design-complete but implementation-frozen\*\*.



---



\## What Has Been Completed for v2



The following v2 scoping work is complete and locked:



\### 1. Non-Negotiable Invariants

\- Historical immutability

\- Explicit authority only

\- Reviewer supremacy

\- Deterministic records

\- Clear separation from v1.x semantics



\### 2. Minimum Viable v2 Concepts

\- Governance events

\- Authority assertions

\- Interpretation layers

\- Endorsement events

\- Explicit v2 decision records



\### 3. Explicit Exclusions

v2 does \*\*not\*\*:

\- Infer authority

\- Resolve disputes automatically

\- Judge ethics, legality, or intent

\- Reinterpret historical decisions

\- Become a consensus or distributed system

\- Optimize for convenience over clarity



\### 4. Implementation Boundary

\- v2 may only \*\*add\*\* artifacts

\- v2 may \*\*not\*\* modify v1.x ledgers, bundles, replay behavior, or tags

\- v2 must exist as parallel, explicitly versioned records



\### 5. Minimal Conceptual Data Schema

\- Governance event ledger (separate, append-only)

\- Authority assertion records

\- Interpretation declarations

\- Endorsements as signals

\- v2-only decision records

\- Optional derived governance snapshots



All of the above are \*\*design artifacts only\*\*.



---



\## Explicit Freeze Declaration



As of this document:



> \*\*No v2 implementation work is authorized.\*\*



This includes:

\- Code changes

\- Schema creation

\- Data files

\- Replay extensions

\- Runtime flags

\- Partial prototypes



Any such work would require an explicit reversal of this freeze.



---



\## Conditions Required to Revisit v2



v2 implementation may be reconsidered \*\*only if all of the following are true\*\*:



1\. \*\*Concrete external demand\*\*

&nbsp;  - A real stakeholder requirement that v1.x cannot meet



2\. \*\*Explicit mandate or funding\*\*

&nbsp;  - Time, budget, or governance approval to support added complexity



3\. \*\*Acceptance of version separation\*\*

&nbsp;  - v2 would be a clearly declared, breaking evolution

&nbsp;  - v1.4 remains preserved and auditable



4\. \*\*Audit readiness\*\*

&nbsp;  - Willingness to defend v2 semantics under hostile review



Absent these conditions, the freeze remains in effect.



---



\## Governance Rationale



This freeze protects the system’s core strengths:



\- Auditability

\- Explainability

\- Historical integrity

\- Reviewer trust

\- Scope discipline



Implementing v2 prematurely would introduce complexity without proportional value and risk eroding these guarantees.



---



\## Summary Statement



> v2 of the Sovereignty Control System is intentionally scoped, documented, and deferred.  

> The current system is complete, defensible, and sufficient.  

> Future evolution is preserved without obligation.
