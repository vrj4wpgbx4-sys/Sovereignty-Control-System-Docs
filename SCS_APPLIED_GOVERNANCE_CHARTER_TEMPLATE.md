\# Applied Governance Charter Template  

Aligned with the Sovereignty Control System (SCS) Doctrine



\## 1. Purpose of This Charter



This charter defines how authority, decision-making, and accountability will be exercised within this entity:



> \[Insert entity name: family, trust, enterprise, or organization]



It is explicitly aligned with the principles articulated in the Sovereignty Control System (SCS) Doctrine (`docs/SCS\_DOCTRINE.md`), which treats:



\- Authority as something that must be \*\*explicitly declared\*\*

\- Power as something that must be \*\*bounded and accountable\*\*

\- History as something that must be \*\*permanent and reviewable\*\*



This charter does not depend on running the SCS software.  

It adopts its principles as \*\*governance constraints\*\*.



---



\## 2. Scope of This Charter



This charter governs:



\- Who may make decisions on behalf of the entity

\- Under what conditions those decisions are legitimate

\- How decisions are recorded and reviewed

\- How emergency powers are defined and constrained

\- How delegation and succession are handled



It applies to:



\- Financial decisions

\- Strategic decisions

\- Structural changes (ownership, control, governance)

\- Emergency or exceptional actions



---



\## 3. Core Governance Principles



The entity adopts the following non-negotiable principles, adapted from the SCS Doctrine:



\### 3.1 Explicit Authority Declaration



No decision with material impact may be made without an explicit, pre-existing grant of authority.



\- Authority must be written, dated, and attributable

\- Authority cannot be inferred from role alone

\- Authority cannot be reconstructed after the fact



\*\*If authority is not documented before the decision, the decision is illegitimate.\*\*



---



\### 3.2 Immutable Historical Record



All significant decisions must be recorded in a permanent, tamper-evident way.



\- Records may be appended, never erased

\- Corrections are additive, not destructive

\- Prior versions of decisions must remain accessible



\*\*There is no such thing as a “clean rollback” of history.\*\*



The specific medium (digital log, minute book, registry, etc.) may vary, but the principles of permanence and traceability must be preserved.



---



\### 3.3 No Retroactive Legitimacy



Decisions are judged under the rules and authority in effect \*\*at the time they were made\*\*.



\- Policies apply prospectively, not retroactively

\- New rules cannot be used to justify past actions

\- Past decisions cannot be reclassified to appear legitimate



\*\*Legitimacy cannot be added after the fact.\*\*



---



\### 3.4 Bounded Emergency Powers



Emergency powers, if they exist at all, must be:



\- Defined in advance

\- Narrow in scope

\- Clearly time-bound or condition-bound

\- Fully recorded when used



Emergency powers may accelerate the use of existing authority, but may not expand it.



\*\*An emergency is not grounds for new powers.\*\*



---



\### 3.5 Observational Replay Only



Review of decisions (by audit, family council, board, or external reviewer) is strictly observational.



\- Review cannot alter the original decision record

\- Review cannot “rewrite” who was responsible

\- Review cannot introduce new authority retroactively



Reviews may result in \*\*new\*\* decisions (amendments, remediation, restitution), but the original record remains intact.



---



\### 3.6 No Silent Delegation



Authority may be delegated, but never silently.



\- All delegations must be written, dated, and attributable

\- The scope and limits of delegation must be explicit

\- Sub-delegation must be either explicitly allowed or explicitly forbidden



\*\*No one may act “on behalf of” the entity without a clear, documented delegation.\*\*



---



\### 3.7 Policy → Decision → Enforcement Traceability



For any material outcome, the entity must be able to trace:



1\. The policy or principle being applied  

2\. The decision that interpreted or applied that policy  

3\. The action(s) taken as a result  



Breaks in traceability must be treated as governance failures and investigated.



---



\## 4. Roles and Authority Structure



> Replace bracketed sections with your own structure.



\### 4.1 Governing Body



The ultimate governing body of this entity is:



> \[e.g., “Family Council”, “Board of Managers”, “Trust Protector Committee”]



Responsibilities:



\- Define and adopt policies

\- Grant and revoke authority

\- Oversee emergency powers

\- Review material decisions and records



\### 4.2 Executing Roles



Executing roles (those who act on decisions) include:



> \[e.g., “Trustee”, “Managing Member”, “CEO”, “Operations Lead”]



Each executing role must have:



\- A written definition of scope

\- A list of decisions they may make

\- Any explicit exclusions or constraints



\### 4.3 Advisory Roles



Advisory roles may exist (e.g., legal, financial, strategic advisors), but:



\- Advisory authority is \*\*not\*\* execution authority

\- Advisors may recommend, not decide

\- Any crossover into decision-making must be explicitly authorized and documented



---



\## 5. Decision Classes and Recording Requirements



Decisions are categorized to ensure appropriate levels of formality and recording.



\### 5.1 Class A — Foundational Decisions



Examples:

\- Creation or amendment of governing documents

\- Changes in ownership or control structures

\- Appointment or removal of key decision-makers

\- Creation or revocation of emergency powers



Requirements:

\- Formal meeting or process

\- Written resolution or equivalent

\- Permanent record in the primary governance log



---



\### 5.2 Class B — Strategic or High-Impact Decisions



Examples:

\- Major asset allocations or transfers

\- Long-term commitments or contracts

\- Jurisdictional changes or restructurings



Requirements:

\- Written proposal or summary

\- Clear authority reference

\- Entry in the decision log



---



\### 5.3 Class C — Operational Decisions



Examples:

\- Routine expenses within budget

\- Day-to-day operations

\- Actions explicitly covered by prior Class A/B decisions



Requirements:

\- Recorded in operational logs where appropriate

\- Escalated to Class B or A if impact exceeds thresholds defined in policy



---



\## 6. Emergency Powers (If Adopted)



If the entity adopts emergency powers, they must be defined in a separate section or annex that includes:



\- Who may invoke an emergency

\- Under what conditions

\- Which powers are activated

\- Maximum duration or automatic review points

\- Recording requirements for each invocation



Example clause:



> “Emergency powers permit temporary suspension of normal decision sequencing only for the purpose of protecting defined critical assets or preventing irreversible harm. All emergency actions must be recorded within 24 hours and are subject to mandatory review.”



---



\## 7. Delegation and Succession



\### 7.1 Delegation



All delegations must:



\- Identify the grantor, grantee, scope, and duration

\- Be recorded in the governance log

\- Be revocable under defined conditions



\### 7.2 Succession



This charter should reference or incorporate any existing succession instruments (e.g., wills, trust documents, operating agreements) and clarify:



\- How successors assume authority

\- How authority handover is recorded

\- How disputes are handled



---



\## 8. Review and Audit



The entity commits to periodic review of:



\- Decision logs

\- Delegations

\- Use (or non-use) of emergency powers

\- Alignment with stated policies



Reviews may be internal or external, but in all cases:



\- Findings must be recorded

\- Recommendations must be documented

\- Follow-up decisions must be traceable



---



\## 9. Alignment with SCS Principles



This charter is \*\*inspired by and aligned with\*\* the Sovereignty Control System Doctrine. It adopts SCS’s core stance that:



\- Authority must be explicit

\- History must be immutable

\- Emergencies do not justify unbounded power

\- Legitimacy is earned through accountability



This charter does \*\*not\*\* require running the SCS software.  

It applies SCS-style constraints to human and institutional governance.



---



\## 10. Amendment of This Charter



This charter may be amended, but:



\- Amendments must be recorded as Class A decisions

\- Amendments cannot retroactively legitimize past actions

\- Amendments must preserve the core principles of explicit authority, immutable history, and bounded power
